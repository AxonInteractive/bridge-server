## Description

This node.js module provides an API development framework for browser-based webapps. It features a broad range of commonly-used features from authentication to analytics to email notifications. While it is targeted at Axon's websites and eLearning portals, it can handle a wide array of websites and API needs.

## Usage

This module is available from the npm package registry. Install it with the following command:

```bash
npm install axon-bridge-server
```

Once installed, simply require axon-bridge-server into your project:
